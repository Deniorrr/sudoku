## General info
This project helps you to solve a classic sudoku puzzle by revealing one tile at a time or by solving the whole puzzle for you, but what's the fun of it then?
	
## Setup
To run the project download the repo and start up "index.html"

## User manual
Select the tile to write in a digit from 1 to 9. Fill that way every tile you need. Then press button "Save".
After saving you can either find and reveal one new tile by pressing "Find one" or find many tiles (:warning:not all:warning:) at a time by clicking "Find many".
Found digits will appear on the board.
To reset everything you'll have to press the red button "Clear everything"

## Inspiration
I came up with this idea while helping my parents to solve a sudoku puzzle.
